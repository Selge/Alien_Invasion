This is a first edition of my PET-project "Alien Invasion". 
The project is based on the "Python crash course" book by E.Matthes with some changes.
Images and sounds are taken from the Internet, I have just added minor changes. 
I love to create a small computer games for the white collar workers. "AI" was planned as a small game with a 1970-th style.

HOW TO PLAY:
The goal is to destroy the alien invaders fleet before enemy ships reach you.
