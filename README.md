# Alien Invasion

### Project description:
This is a first edition of my PET-project "Alien Invasion". I love to create a small computer games for the white collar workers and "AI" was planned as a small game in 1970-th style.
The project is based on the **"Python crash course"** book by **E.Matthes** with some new ideas. Images and sounds are taken from the Internet, I have just added minor changes.
