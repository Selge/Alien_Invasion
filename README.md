# 'U.F.O. 77'

### Project description:
A tiny game 'U.F.O. 77'. I love to create a small computer games for the white collar workers and "UFO" was planned as a small game in 1970-th style.
The project is based on the **"Python crash course"** book by **E.Matthes** with some additional features. Images and sounds are taken from the Internet, I have just added minor changes.
